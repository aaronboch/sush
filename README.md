# Super Shell (sush)
Super Shell (sush) is a simple Shell program written in C++.

  

## Compiling & Running

  This code was only compiled and tested on Linux and will only compile on Unix systems due to some dependencies like <unistd.h>

```
//its really simple
$ make
$ ./sush

```

### No Order

- being able to escape $ in export command
- I/O redirection (<,>,>>)
- piping (|)
- signal handling (ctrl-c)
- go up and down history (up arrow, down arrow)

### Maybes

  

- tab autocomplete
- parallel execution (&,&&)
- being able to move cursor left/right
